      <p>
        The conference program runs for two days across multiple tracks.
        Presentations may be in the form of a talk, workshop, jam or a combo.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Talk (30 minutes)</h3>
        <p>
          Talks are conventional conference presentations of 30 minutes
          including questions. They are conducted in a lecture format
          providing a focused explanation on a single topic. Some talks are
          an introduction to a subsequent Workshop or Jam - see Combo below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Workshop (3 hours)</h3>
        <p>
          Workshops take the audience through the technical details of a
          specific technology. They are smaller and more slowly paced than
          talks and leave plenty of room for questions and discussions.
          Workshops should provide the attendee with sufficient detail and
          references to get started on a new technology. Workshops typically
          last for 180 minutes, and they include plenty of concrete code
          examples.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Jam (2.5 hours)</h3>
        <p>
          Jams are an opportunity for attendees to code using their favorite
          or a new FP language . Attendees will solve the Jam problem by
          writing code together, while being guided by the conductor of the
          Jam. The software requirements and expected background knowledge will
          be announced in the program, so that all participants can ensure that
          they are prepared to code right from the start. Jams typically run
          for 150 minutes and allow for sufficient time to answer questions and
          solve problems. At the end of the Jam each time will present their
          solution.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Combo</h3>
        <p>
          Many talks provide an introduction to a topic that is covered in more
          detail in a Workshop. In a Combo, the Talk introduces general
          concepts of a technology and might serve as an introduction to get
          people interested in the subsequent Workshop. The Workshop provides
          the gory details needed to use technology introduced in the Talk in
          practice.

          There will also be an opportunity for short 5 minute lightning talks
          throughout the conference. There is no need to submit for a lightning
          talk via this process.

        <h2 class="huge">Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          The audience for YOW! Lambda Jam is functional programmers who are
          looking to increase their skills. It will provide attendees with a
          fast paced exposure to intermediate and advanced concepts. Therefore,
          your presentation should contribute to their knowledge and development
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following are some of the topic areas we are looking for
          submissions on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Core functional programming - the bread and butter of the
            functional programmer, but pushing the envelope a bit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Production functional programming - what cool things are being done
            with functional programming in production systems which offer
            lessons to others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cutting edge/different functional programming - The bleeding edge
            of the field of functional programming as well as un-thought of
            usages of functional programming languages and techniques.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Provide sufficient detail in your submission to enable the reviewers
          to understand your proposal and clearly identify what an attendee
          will gain by from attending your session. You should include the
          following information in the submission system:
