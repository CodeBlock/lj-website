          <h3>Talk (40 minutes)</h3>
          <p>
            Conventional conference
            presentations of 40 minutes including questions. They are conducted in
            a lecture format providing a focused explanation on a single topic.
            Audiences will be approximately 100-150 people.

          <h3>Workshop (3 hours)</h3>
          <p>
            Take the audience through the
            technical details of a specific language, technology, or technique.
            They are delivered to a small audience (25-30 people) and typically
            consist of instruction and hands-on exercises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Workshop speakers may be requested to give their workshop more than
            once. There is a workshop stipend of $200 per workshop given in
            recognition of the extra work involved.

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Jam (3 hours)</h3>
          <p>
            An opportunity for attendees to get
            their hands dirty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial concept is that jams will be similar to code katas. The
            jam will lay out an initial problem and attendees will be encouraged
            to work on the problem in groups (language choice is open). After
            about an hour, mentors may further guide or redirect the problem based
            on feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            After approximately two hours, there will be a demo period where
            groups can present an interesting part of their solution. This is a
            great time to talk about language-specific features or examples,
            implementation techniques, etc.

        <p>
          The audience for Lambda Jam is functional programmers who are looking
          to increase their skills. We expect to have a wide range of experience
          levels from newbie to expert and content is needed for the entire
          range. Please feel comfortable to submit intro and deep technical
          talks.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is perfectly fine to submit multiple talks or talks in more than
          one area. If you are submitting more than two or three talks, please
