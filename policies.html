        <h3>Diversity Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Platitudes are cheap. We've all heard services say they're committed
          to &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot; without ever getting specific, so
          here's our stance on it:
        </p>
        <p><strong>We welcome you.</strong></p>
        <p>
          We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race,
          ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level,
          neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture,
          subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification.
          We welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, dilettantes,
          musicians, photographers, readers, writers, ordinary people,
          extraordinary people, and everyone in between. We welcome people who
          want to change the world, people who want to keep in touch with
          friends, people who want to make great art, and people who just need
          a break after work. We welcome fans, geeks, and nerds.  We welcome
          you no matter if the Internet was a household word by the time you
          started secondary school or whether you were already retired by the
          time the World Wide Web was invented.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome you. You may wear a baby sling, hijab, a kippah, leather,
          piercings, a pentacle, a political badge, a rainbow, a rosary,
          tattoos, or something we can only dream of. You may carry a guitar or
          knitting needles or a sketchbook. Conservative or liberal,
          libertarian or socialist - we believe it's possible for people of all
          viewpoints and persuasions to come together and learn from each
          other. We believe in the broad spectrum of individual and collective
          experience and in the inherent dignity of all people. We believe that
          amazing things come when people from different worlds and world-views
          approach each other to create a conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We get excited about creativity - from pro to amateur, from novels to
          haiku, from the photographer who's been doing this for decades to the
          person who just picked up a sketchbook last week. We support maximum
          freedom of creative expression, within the few restrictions we need
          to keep the service viable for other users. We're serious about
          knowing and protecting your rights when it comes to free expression
          and privacy. We will never put a limit on your creativity just
          because it makes someone uncomfortable - even if that someone is us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We think accessibility for people with disabilities is a priority,
          not an afterthought. We think neurodiversity is a feature, not a bug.
          We believe in being inclusive, welcoming, and supportive of anyone
          who comes to us with good faith and the desire to build a community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have enough experience to know that we won't get any of this
          perfect on the first try. But we have enough hope, energy, and
          idealism to want to learn things we don't know now. We may not be
          able to satisfy everyone, but we can certainly work to avoid
          offending anyone. And we promise that if we get it wrong, we'll
          listen carefully and respectfully to you when you point it out to us,
          and weâ€™ll do our best to make good on our mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We think our technical and business experience is important, but we
          think our community experience is more important. We know what goes
          wrong when companies say one thing and do another, or when they
          refuse to say anything at all. We believe that keeping our operations
          transparent is just as important as keeping our servers stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the service we're selling, and we built it because we wanted
          it ourselves. We won't treat people as second-class undesirables
          because they're non-mainstream or might frighten advertisers. We
          don't have advertisers to frighten. To us, you're not eyeballs.
          You're not page views. You're not demographic groups. You're people.
        </p>
        <p>Come dream with us.</p>

        <h3>Anti Harassment Policy</h3>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
          experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
          disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do
          not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
          Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
          venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules
          may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at
          the discretion of the conference organizers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any form of written, social media, or verbal communication that can
          be offensive or harassing to any attendee, speaker or staff is not
          allowed at Lambda Jam. Please inform a staff member if you feel a
          violation has taken place and the conference leadership team will
          address the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
          sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
          race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate
          intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or
          recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
          inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
          comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
          activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
          particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
          or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
          sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
          sexualized environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
          organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
          warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
          harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
          conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by
          t-shirts and special badges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact
          hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
          otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
          duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues
          and conference-related social events.
